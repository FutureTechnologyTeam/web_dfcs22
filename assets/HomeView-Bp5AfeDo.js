The gradual maturity of software design theory and the rapid development and productization of hardware design and implementation provide a good foundation and opportunity for solving the above problems. </span></div></div>',2)]))}const H=l(R,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-c4ec8a4a"]]),G={__name:"HomeView",setup(n){return(e,v)=>(t(),o(p,null,[a(h),a(O),a(H),a(P)],64))}};export{G as default};
